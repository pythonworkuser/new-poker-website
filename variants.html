                <h2>Poker Variants</h2>
                <p>Explore the diverse world of poker with different game variants beyond the standard Texas Hold'em.</p>

                <h3>Pot-Limit Omaha (PLO)</h3>
                <p>As mentioned in the rules, PLO is a popular action game where players receive four hole cards and must use exactly two of them with three community cards. The pot-limit betting structure leads to larger and more frequent pots compared to No-Limit Hold'em.</p>

                <h3>Seven-Card Stud</h3>
                <p>A classic poker game where players are dealt seven cards individually throughout the hand. There are no community cards, and players must make the best five-card hand from their own seven cards. Betting occurs on each street (round of cards dealt).</p>

                <h3>Five-Card Draw</h3>
                <p>A simple and classic poker game. Players are dealt five cards face down and there is a round of betting. Players then have the option to discard one or more cards and replace them with new ones from the deck (the "draw"). A final round of betting follows.</p>

                <h3>Mixed Games</h3>
                <p>Experienced players often enjoy mixed games, which rotate through different poker variants. This requires players to be proficient in multiple games and adds an extra layer of strategy. Common mixed games include H.O.R.S.E. (Hold'em, Omaha Hi/Lo, Razz, Seven-Card Stud, Seven-Card Stud Hi/Lo) and 8-Game Mix.</p>
