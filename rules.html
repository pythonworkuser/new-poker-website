                <h2>Poker Rules</h2>
                <p>Learn the fundamental rules of popular poker games like Texas Hold'em, Omaha, and Seven-Card Stud.</p>

                <h3>Texas Hold'em Basics</h3>
                <p>Each player is dealt two private cards ("hole cards"). Five community cards are dealt face up in three stages: a flop (three cards), a turn (one card), and a river (one card). Players have to make the best five-card poker hand from any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards.</p>
                <p>Betting occurs before the flop, after the flop, after the turn, and after the river.</p>

                <h3>Omaha Rules</h3>
                 <p>Omaha is similar to Texas Hold'em, but each player is dealt four hole cards instead of two. A player must use exactly two of their hole cards and exactly three of the five community cards to make their best five-card hand.</p>
                 <p>Omaha is commonly played in Pot-Limit format (Pot-Limit Omaha or PLO), where the maximum bet is limited to the current size of the pot.</p>

                 <h3>Seven-Card Stud Rules</h3>
                 <p>In Seven-Card Stud, players are individually dealt seven cards throughout the hand, but only the best five-card hand using any combination of their seven cards is used to determine the winner. There are no community cards.</p>
                 <p>The game involves a series of betting rounds after certain cards are dealt face up or face down.</p>
