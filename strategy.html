                <h2>Poker Strategy</h2>
                <p>Improve your game with essential poker strategies, including starting hand selection, position, and bluffing.</p>

                <h3>Starting Hand Selection</h3>
                <p>Choosing which hands to play before the flop is fundamental. Strong starting hands like pocket Aces (AA), Kings (KK), Queens (QQ), and Jacks (JJ) are usually profitable from any position. Premium Broadway hands like Ace-King suited (AKs) and Ace-Queen suited (AQs) are also very strong.</p>
                <p>Hands like small pairs, suited connectors (e.g., 7s8s), and suited gappers (e.g., 9sJs) can be profitable but often require careful consideration of your position at the table and the actions of other players.</p>

                <h3>Importance of Position</h3>
                <p>Your position at the poker table relative to the dealer button is a significant factor in strategy. Being in a later position means you act after most of your opponents, giving you more information about their hands and intentions before you have to make a decision. This allows you to play a wider range of hands profitably and control the size of the pot more effectively.</p>

                <h3>Bluffing</h3>
                <p>Bluffing is an advanced strategy that involves betting or raising with a weak hand to make your opponents fold stronger hands. Successful bluffing requires understanding your opponents, the board texture, and the story your actions tell. Over-bluffing or bluffing in the wrong situations can be very costly.</p>
